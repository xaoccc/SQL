"country_code" - column should be exactly two characters long. 
... add a new row to the "monasteries" table with 'Hanga Abbey' as the name and 'Tanzania' as the country code ...

Another row should also be inserted into the "monasteries" table with 'Myin-Tin-Daik' as the name and 'Myanmar' as the country code. - this should be ignored!
